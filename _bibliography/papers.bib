abstract = {We present two prototypes of a gigabit transceiver ASIC, GBCR1 and GBCR2, both designed in a 65-nm CMOS technology for the ATLAS Inner Tracker Pixel Detector readout upgrade. The first prototype, GBCR1, has four upstream receiver channels and one downstream transmitter channel with pre-emphasis. Each upstream channel receives the data at 5.12 Gbps through a 5 m AWG34 Twinax cable from an ASIC driver located on the pixel module and restores the signal from the high frequency loss due to the low mass cable. The signal is retimed by a recovered clock before it is sent to the optical transmitter VTRx+. The downstream driver is designed to transmit the 2.56 Gbps signal from lpGBT to the electronics on the pixel module over the same cable. The peak–peak jitter (throughout the paper jitter is always peak–peak unless specified) of the restored signal is 35.4 ps at the output of GBCR1, and 138 ps for the downstream channel at the cable ends. GBCR1 consumes 318 mW and is tested. The second prototype, GBCR2, has seven upstream channels and two downstream channels. Each upstream channel works at 1.28 Gbps to recover the data directly from the RD53B ASIC through a 1 m custom FLEX cable followed by a 6 m AWG34 Twinax cable. The equalized signal of each upstream channel is retimed by an input 1.28 GHz phase programmable clock. Compared with the signal at the FLEX input, the additional jitter of the equalized signal is about 80 ps when the retiming logic is off. When the retiming logic is on, the jitter is 50 ps at GBCR2 output, assuming the 1.28 GHz retiming clock is from lpGBT. The downstream is designed to transmit the 160 Mbps signal from lpGBT through the same cable connection to RD53B and the jitter is about 157 ps at the cable ends. GBCR2 consumes about 150 mW when the retiming logic is off. This design was submitted in November 2019.}

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
