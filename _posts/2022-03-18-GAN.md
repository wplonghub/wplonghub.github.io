### part 1: training a stable GAN

Training procedure:
1. use real image to train the discriminator
2. generate fake image and use fake image to train the discriminator
   - first, generate latent points (random vector/tensor)
   - second, give latent points to the generator to generate fake image
   - third, use fake iimage to train the discriminator
3. generate latent points and labels
4. use latent points and labels to train GAN model and get the loss
   - in the GAN model training process, discriminator training is disabled; so only generator is trained
   - the output from GAN model (Generator + Discriminator(training disabled)) is the GAN loss
5. GAN model performance is evaluated and saved
   - generate latent points and give them to the generator to generate fake image
   - fake image is saved for evaluation and GAN model weights are saved

##### * what is latent space?

{% highlight python linenos %}

# generate points in latent space as input for the generator
def generate_latent_points(latent_dim, n_samples):
	# generate points in the latent space
	x_input = randn(latent_dim * n_samples)
	# reshape into a batch of inputs for the network
	x_input = x_input.reshape(n_samples, latent_dim)
	return x_input
